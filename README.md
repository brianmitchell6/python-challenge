Week 3 Challenge

Name of file containing Python code is main.py for both PyBank and PyPoll.

Used Ben Brown's solution posted on Slack to find the path.

Consulted geeksforgeeks.org quite a bit while debugging.  Did not copy code, but explanations and examples provided templates for some of my code.  Mostly with file reading and writing. 

Output file for both PyBank and PyPoll is result.tx in analysis folder.
